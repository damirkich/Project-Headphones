        <p>
          The history of Bose Corporation began with disappointment. In 1956, MIT
          graduate student Amar Bose bought one of the best stereo systems at the
          time for his home. After a few minutes of listening to the audio
          recording, his bewilderment turned to disappointment.

          From Amar's point of view, the sound was so flat and unnatural that it was
          better not to listen to the music at all than to listen to it in such a
          distorted form.
        </p>

          Bose's frustration grew into a firm determination to build audio
          equipments that would reproduce sound with impeccable accuracy and
          naturalness
